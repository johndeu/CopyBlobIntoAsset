## IMPORTANT! Update your Azure Media Services REST API and SDKs to v3 by 29 February 2024

Because version 3 of Azure Media Services REST API and client SDKs for .NET and Java offers more capabilities than version 2, we’re retiring version 2 of the Azure Media Services REST API and client SDKs for .NET and Java.

### Action Required:
To minimize disruption to your workloads, review the migration guide to transition your code from the version 2 to version 3 API and SDK before 29 February 2024. 

After 29 February 2024, Azure Media Services will no longer accept traffic on the version 2 REST API, the ARM account management API version 2015-10-01, or from the version 2 .NET client SDKs. This includes any 3rd party open-source client SDKS that may call the version 2 API.

# (DEPRECATED) CopyBlobIntoAsset

This sample shows how to copy existing blobs from a storage account into a new Azure Media Services asset.

Your blobs could exist in a storage account that is associated with Media Services account, or storage account that is not associated with Media Services account. This sample demonstrates how to copy blobs from a storage account into a Media Services Asset. Note that you can also copy across Data Centers. However, there may be charges incurred by doing so. For more information about pricing, see [Data Transfers](http://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/#header-11).

>[AZURE.NOTE] You should not attempt to change the contents of blob containers that were generated by Media Services without using Media Service APIs.

##Prerequisites for running this sample
